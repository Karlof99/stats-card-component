## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

I learned that the best way to improve skills is practicing and not only viewing guided tutorials all the time. When I was building this challenge forced me to remember what I've learned.

### Continued development

I want to improve my hability in HTML, CSS, JS, Flexbox, Grid, Bootstrap, Webflow, Sketch and Figma in the next projects.
